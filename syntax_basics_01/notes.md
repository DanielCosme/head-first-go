I want a simple language that has types, or a static typing system. Golang has a 
structural typing system.
I come seeking refuge from Javascript, Java and c++.
I like and enjoy C-like languages.
It should compile fast and run fast.
I want a modern language that is cloud native and concurrent concurrent for a 
distributed world.

Simplicity and speed. Concurrent programs.
Mantainability and readability.

## Strings
Strings are a collections of bytes that represent characters

## Naming conventions
Exported functions/variables are Capitalized (camel case)
Non-exported functions/variables are pascalCase.

When te meaning of a name is obvious from the context, the convention
is to abbreviate it to use i insted of index, max instead of maximum etc.
